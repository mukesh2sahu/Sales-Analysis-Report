# Sales-Analysis-Report

I created a Sales Analysis Report for Mukesh Mart, showcasing key insights into sales performance, profitability, and regional breakdowns. 🛍️📊

🔍 Highlights of the Report:
Sales Trends: Visualized yearly growth in sales over time.
Profitability Insights: Identified regions and subcategories contributing most to profits.
Performance Metrics: Monitored KPIs like total quantity sold, discount given, and sales by category.
Interactive Dashboards: Designed an intuitive and user-friendly layout to enable better decision-making.
Power BI's powerful visualization tools made it easy to uncover actionable insights and present data in an impactful way!

💡 This project has strengthened my skills in data visualization, business intelligence, and data-driven storytelling.

I’m always open to feedback and discussions on improving business reporting. Let me know your thoughts!
